From http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/natural-amenities-scale.aspx

The natural amenities scale is a measure of the physical characteristics of a county area that enhance the location as a place to live. The scale was constructed by combining six measures of climate, topography, and water area that reflect environmental qualities most people prefer. 

These measures are 
    warm winter
    winter sun
    temperate summer
    low summer humidity
    topographic variation
    water area

The data are available for counties in the lower 48 States. The file contains the original measures and standardized scores for each county as well as the amenities scale.
